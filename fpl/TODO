BUG:
function calls which return a struct, if that struct aliases one of the function arguments, the aliasing is not detected - results in incorrect codegen.
Iteration when the iteration variable is a struct - things get corrupted - looks like it messes up the reference to the struct with its first element
Sequencer is occasionally creating incorrect code for array writes. Needs debugging.
